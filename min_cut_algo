Min Cut Problem
In a flow network an s-t cut is a cut that requires the source and sink to be in diff subsets and it consists all edges from source side to the sink side .
Capacity of an s-t cut is defined as the sum of capacities of each edge in the cut.
Algorithm
1- Run the ford algorithm and calculate the final residual graph.
2- find the set of vertices that are reachable from source.
3- All the edges that are non-reachable vertices from a reachable vertex are min cut edges.
